This document provides the specific scripts, survey questions, and protocols required to conduct the experimental sessions as outlined in the main methodology.

### **1. Pre-Session Materials**

#### **A. Pre-Session Questionnaire & Consent**

_(To be administered before the session begins)_

1. **Informed Consent Form:**
    
    - _(A standard university consent form should be used here, detailing the study's purpose, the **~90 minute duration**, the use of screen and audio recording, data anonymization, the right to withdraw at any time, and compensation.)_
        
2. **Demographics:**
    
    - What is your current level of study? (e.g., Undergraduate, Master's, PhD)
        
    - How would you rate your programming experience? (0-None, 1-Beginner, 2-Intermediate, 3-Advanced)
        
    - How familiar are you with Python? (1-Not at all, 2-A little, 3-Comfortable)
        
    - Have you used AI coding assistants (like GitHub Copilot) before? (Yes/No)
        

### **2. In-Session Protocols & Scripts**

#### **A. Onboarding & Think-Aloud Protocol Script**

_"Thank you for participating in this study. Today, we're going to be looking at different AI tools that help people learn to code. You'll be working on a couple of short programming tasks in a web-based code editor that looks like VS Code._

_The most important thing to know is that **we are not testing you or your programming skill**. We are testing the tools. There are no right or wrong ways to complete the tasks, and it's completely okay if you get stuck or make mistakes. In fact, that's very useful information for us._

_During the tasks, I'm going to ask you to **"think aloud."** This just means I'd like you to say whatever is going through your mind as you work. For example, if you're confused, you could say "I'm not sure what this part of the tutorial means," or if you're making a decision, "Okay, I think I need to create a function first." Please also feel free to express frustration, like "Ugh, this AI isn't helping." The more you can narrate your thoughts, the better._

_You'll be using two different AI assistants today. One is designed to give direct code suggestions, and the other is designed to be more of a guide that asks questions. It's important to know that one of them may feel more challenging to use, and that is intentional. Any frustration you feel is a valuable part of the data._

_Do you have any questions before we begin with a short warm-up task?"_

#### **B. Near-Transfer Task Script**

_(To be administered after both main conditions are complete, before the final interview)_

_"Thank you. We're now finished with the main part of the study. For the final step, I'm going to give you one last short programming task. For this task, the AI assistant will be disabled, and I'd like you to solve it on your own using what you've learned today. Please complete the following: **'Create a simple `House` class with a `draw` method that draws a basic house shape using the turtle.'**"_

### **3. Post-Condition Surveys**

_(This entire block of surveys is administered **twice**: once immediately after the Vibecoding condition, and once immediately after the Reflective AI condition.)_

#### **A. NASA-TLX (Task Load Index)**

_(Participants rate each of the following six scales from Low to High)_

1. **Mental Demand:** How much mental and perceptual activity was required?
    
2. **Temporal Demand:** How much time pressure did you feel?
    
3. **Performance:** How successful do you think you were in accomplishing the goals?
    
4. **Effort:** How hard did you have to work to accomplish your level of performance?
    
5. **Frustration:** How insecure, discouraged, irritated, and stressed versus secure, gratified, content, and relaxed did you feel?
    

#### **B. System Usability Scale (SUS)**

_(Participants rate their agreement on a 5-point scale from Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree)_

1. I think that I would like to use this AI assistant frequently.
    
2. I found the AI assistant unnecessarily complex.
    
3. I thought the AI assistant was easy to use.
    
4. I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this AI assistant.
    
5. I found the various functions in this AI assistant were well integrated.
    
6. I thought there was too much inconsistency in this AI assistant.
    
7. I would imagine that most people would learn to use this AI assistant very quickly.
    
8. I found the AI assistant very cumbersome to use.
    
9. I felt very confident using the AI assistant.
    
10. I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this AI assistant.
    

#### **C. Code Comprehension Survey**

_(Participants are shown the final code they produced in the just-completed condition)_

1. On a scale of 1 (Not at all) to 7 (Completely), how well do you feel you understand how this code works?
    
2. **[Multiple Choice]** What is the purpose of the `__init__` method in a class?
    
    - a) To draw the object on the screen.
        
    - b) To set up the object's initial properties when it's created.
        
    - c) To delete the object when it's no longer needed.
        
    - d) I'm not sure.
        
3. **[Short Answer]** In your own words, what does the `self` keyword refer to inside the `Rectangle` class?
    
4. **[Short Answer]** If you wanted to create a `Rectangle` that was twice as tall as it was wide, how would you change the line where you create the object?
    

### **4. Post-Session Semi-Structured Interview Protocol**

_(To be conducted at the very end of the session)_

1. **General Experience:** "To start, can you just tell me about your overall experience today? What was it like working on these tasks?"
    
2. **Comparative Experience:** "You used two different AI assistants today. Can you describe the difference between working with the first one versus the second one?"
    
3. **Probing Agency & Ownership:**
    
    - "Think about the final `Rectangle` code you created in both conditions. Which one felt more like 'your' code? Why?"
        
    - "Was there a time you felt you were in control of the process? Was there a time you felt the AI was in control?"
        
4. **Probing Frustration & Learning:**
    
    - "Describe your level of frustration during each of the two main tasks. Was it a 'good' frustration that led to a breakthrough, or a 'bad' frustration that was just an obstacle?"
        
    - "I noticed you stopped using the AI at one point during the [Reflective/Vibecoding] task. Can you tell me what you were thinking at that moment?"
        
5. **Final Thoughts:** "Is there anything else you'd like to share about the tools or your experience that we haven't talked about?"
